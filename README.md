docker image doesn't have `rails db:seed` command

to run locally:

backend(in root directory):
`bundle install`
`rails db:migrate`
`rails db:seed`

front(in client directory)
`npm install`
`npm run dev`

docker image will be updated this evening 6/4/23

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions
